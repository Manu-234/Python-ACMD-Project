# Python-ACMD-Project

Introduction

In this project, there will be two interfaces for users and ambulance staff.
A user upon logging in can:
1.   Update profile information
2.   Access number of and details of ambulances and ambulance drivers in vicinity by inputting locality
3. Input information of current medical problem and required medical equipment
4. Directly contact the driver
A staff member upon logging in can:
1.  View nearby hospitals for urgency
2.  View a particular user’s personal information and medical requirements for checking compatibility
3.  Input estimated time of commute
4. Update their ambulance information
The objective of this project is to create a symbiotic and inter dependent platform for:
1.     users to contact the nearest ambulance in their locality during an emergency
2.     ambulance drivers to locate nearby hospitals at a given time
As per various medical requirements.

BASIC ALGORITHM 
1.  Start
2.  If choice is new user input and
create username and password
3.  If loginchoice is driver input name, age, medical equipment available, hospital linked and create profile
4.  If loginchoice is client input name, age, medical conditions, name and contact number of family doctor and create profile
5.   If choice is existing user input and verify username and password
6.   Input prof
5.   If prof is driver input choice
6.   If choice is 1 input location
7.   If choice is 2 input subchoice
8.   If subchoice is 1 update profile
9.   If subchoice is 2 delete value from profile
10. If subchoice is 3 delete profile
11. If choice is 3 display inbox and input
subchocie
12. If subchoice is y send message to selected client
13. If choice is 4 clear inbox
14. If choice is 5 break
15. If prof is client input choice
16. If choice is 1 input subchoice
17. If subchoice is 1 input location and display available drivers and input sub- subchoice
18. If sub- subchoice is y send message to selected driver
19. If subchoice is 2 break
